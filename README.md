# PostgresSQL_Docker

This repository was created as an exercise in dockerizing a PostgresSQL database and familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub. These are the tasks I've been assigned:

1. Create Git Repo in github
2. Add README.md file for instructions
3. Create `Docker` file to setup and run PostgresSQL DB
4. Write instructions in README to:
    1. SSH into DB
    2. Create table `cool_tools` with columns `name`, `id`, `URL`
    3. BONUS 1: Include SQL code to add an entry to table
    4. BONUS 2: Add extra commands to do other stuff (up to you)

## Instructions

The following are instructions to:

a) setup and run PostgresSQL on Docker;
b) create a PostgresSQL database with a table containing the information provided above;
c) SSH into database and
d) add an entry through SQL code.
