# PostgresSQL_Docker

This repository was created as an exercise in dockerizing a PostgresSQL database and familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub. These are the tasks I've been assigned:

1. Create Git Repo in github
2. Add README.md file for instructions
3. Create `Docker` file to setup and run PostgresSQL DB
4. Write instructions in README to:
    1. SSH into DB
    2. Create table `cool_tools` with columns `name`, `id`, `URL`
    3. BONUS 1: Include SQL code to add an entry to table
    4. BONUS 2: Add extra commands to do other stuff (up to you)

## Pre-requisites
* Linux machine with Docker installed.

## Instructions

Run dbSetup.sh on your terminal (Navigate to the file and enter `./dbSetup.sh`). It will setup and run a container from the official PostgreSQL Docker image. After that, the script will run a command in the container to login to the CLI client 'psql' to create the table `cool_tools`. You can use this table to store neat online tools of your choice.

The table will initially be empty. You can access your database by running the code below, which opens a BASH terminal on your container.
```
docker exec -it postgres-db bash
```

From there, you can login to PostgreSQL with 
```
psql -U postgres
```
Once logged in, try adding an entry to your ´cool_tools´ table using the following template:
```
INSERT INTO cool_tools(name, url) values('name of the tool you like', 'its url');
```
An ID number for each entry will be generated by default.


As an example, try adding an entry for a password manager like [KeePassXC](keepassxc.org) with the following command:
```
INSERT INTO cool_tools(name, url) values('KeePassXC', 'keepassxc.org');
```

To see if it worked, do a simple query by running
```
SELECT * FROM cool_tools;
```
